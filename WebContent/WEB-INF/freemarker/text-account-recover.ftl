    Dear ${to},

</p>

<p>
    To reset your Receiptofi ID password, simply click the link below. That will take you to a web page where you can
    create a new password.

</p>

<p>
    Please note that the link will expire three hours after this email was sent.

</p>

    <a href="${emailUrlProtocol}://${domain}/forgot/authenticate.htm?authenticationKey=${link}">Reset your Receiptofi ID password ></a>

</p>
<hr>
<p>
    If you weren't trying to reset your password, don't worry - your account is still secure and no one has been given
    access to it. Most likely, someone just mistyped their email address while trying to reset their own password.

</p>
Thanks,
<br/>
