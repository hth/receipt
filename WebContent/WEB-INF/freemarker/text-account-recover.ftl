Dear ${to},

To reset your receipt-o-fi ID password, simply click the link below. That will take you to a web page where you can create a new password.

Please note that the link will expire three hours after this email was sent.

Reset your receipt-o-fi ID password by clicking or pasting it in the browser >
http://localhost:8080/receipt/forgot/authenticate.htm?authenticationKey=${link}


If you weren't trying to reset your password, don't worry - your account is still secure and no one has been given access to it. Most likely, someone just mistyped their email address while trying to reset their own password.

Thanks,
receipt-o-fi Customer Support
