Follow the steps mentioned at http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/logging.html#Using_Log4j

Pick log4j from 'lib' folder. Download **tomcat-juli.jar** and **tomcat-juli-adapters.jar** that are available as an "extras" component for Tomcat

If you want to configure Tomcat to use log4j globally:

Put from local/lib log4j.jar and tomcat-juli-adapters.jar from "extras" into $CATALINA_HOME/lib.
Replace $CATALINA_HOME/bin/tomcat-juli.jar with tomcat-juli.jar from "extras".

Delete $CATALINA_BASE/conf/logging.properties to prevent java.util.logging generating zero length log files.
